								<p>On this page we are asking for your help.</p>
								<p>Firstly, and most importantly, for your prayers,</p>
								<ul>
								<li>that we might be effective in making Him known,</li>
								<li>that we might not mess up with our responsibility before Him,</li>
								<li>that we might not lose our focus.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Secondly, you can help us greatly by spreading the Word to others. Let them know that we are free, and won&#39;t subject them to constant nagging via daily e-mail or mailings. Are there magazines or periodicals you read, in which we could advertise our website? Let us know.</p>
								<p>Thirdly, I remember (the late) Keith Green years ago, lamenting that he had ever gotten involved with professional profit-motivated recording companies. They had complete control over the sales of his first album, including it&#39;s price tag. But, as I remember, he sold subsequent albums himself directly; the asking price was &quot;whatever you can afford.&quot;</p>
								<p>I always liked that approach.</p>
								<p>It does not cost $15 to produce a CD. It is less than that. MUCH less.</p>
								<p>To date, we have distributed over 10,000 cassette tapes and CD&#39;s. (We stopped counting at 10,000 long ago.) We have NEVER sold a tape or CD, and don&#39;t plan to start now. Instead we have seen some of God&#39;s people catch the vision of what we are trying to do, and come forward to help out with the costs involved.</p>
								<p>Now we are taking on a new venue, this website. As you probably know, there are costs involved. &#39;Nuff said. We believe the Lord will speak to some to help with the costs involved to keep &quot;Harmony of the Word&quot; available for free.</p>
								<p>If you cannot afford to help, or don&#39;t care to help, that&#39;s okay with us. Use the music to deepen your walk as a gift from us, with our blessing.</p>
								<p>But if you can help, and want to, even with a small amount, we are most grateful, and expect that the Lord will increase your vision and blessing, as you offer a bit of yourself to be used by Him to put this music into the ears of another.</p>
								<p>That&#39;s His way, and that&#39;s why we do what we do. (I Corinthians 9:18)</p>
